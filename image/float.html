      <p>The latest version of ChatGPT, OpenAI’s groundbreaking generative AI chatbot, now has access to real-time information from the internet at large, curing what had been seen as one of its key flaws.</p>

      <p>Thanks to an integration with Microsoft’s Bing search engine – the company is a major investor in ChatGPT maker OpenAI – the AI chatbot is now able to look up the latest available information on any topic. Previously, ChatGPT's answers were based merely on its large language model (LLM) training data, which only ran through September of 2021.</p>

      <p>The browsing feature was originally launched in June 2023, but disabled shortly thereafter, due to what OpenAI called a habit of “occasionally display[ing] content in ways we don’t want,” which reportedly included skipping through paywalls to access content it shouldn’t have. Browsing rolled back out to beta customers of OpenAI Plus (the company’s paid subscription service, which includes access to the more-advanced version 4 of the AI) late last month, and is now out of beta and fully available to Plus customers.</p>
